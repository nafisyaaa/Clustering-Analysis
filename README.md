# Clustering-Analysis
Clustering is as a process of finding group structures within data such that each instance within a group is similar to one another and dissimilar to instances in other groups.

**Study Case**

MxITup is a start-up company driven by young people engaged in the business of Ice Cream, Boba Drinks, and Desserts (snacks). Currently MixITup has 3 branches in Jakarta, Depok, and Tangerang. MixITup received a positive response in the community, queues for dine-in and delivery of MixITup products exceeded service capacity. Last month MixITup received series B funding of Rp. 33 Billion,-. The plan is that MixITup wants to "scale" its business to other cities and carry out massive marketing. Through the lure of a 5% discount on several items in its shop and the distribution of discount promo vouchers, MixITup succeeded in collecting customer data through its member cards (loyalty program). You are a junior Data Analyst at MixITup, your job is to carry out the Data Mining process and provide information/insight and suggestions/recommendations/strategies to the company via data.
